## What is Interactivity?

--

Interactivity refers to the ways in which users can participate in and influence the media they engage with.

--

Types of Interactivity: 

1. Reactive (simple feedback mechanisms)

--

2. Proactive (user-initiated interactions)

--

3. Mutual (two-way communication)

---

### Examples? 

--
* Websites, mobile apps, video games, social media

## Why is interactivity important?

--

From Rafaeli & Ariel (2007):

.pull-left[
* User Engagement

   * Enhances user experience
   * Increases engagement and retention
   ]

--

.pull-right[
* Feedback Mechanism:
   * Allows for immediate user feedback
   * Improves content through user input
   ]

---

## Evolution of Media

From Chaffee & Metzger (2001):

.pull-left[
Traditional Media
`r icons::fontawesome("newspaper")`

`r icons::fontawesome("tv")`

* One-way communication, passive consumption

]

--

.pull-right[
New Media?
`r icons::fontawesome("hashtag")`

`r icons::fontawesome("podcast")`

`r icons::fontawesome("headphones")`

`r icons::fontawesome("mobile")`

* Interactive, user-driven, real-time feedback

]

--

How has the evolution from traditional to new media impacted your media consumption habits?

--

Can you think of an example where new media has significantly improved user engagement?


---

## Technology

* Internet 

--

* Mobile devices

--

* Seamless access to content

--

* User-generated content & participation 

--

What role do mobile devices play in your daily media consumption?

---

## McLuhan (1964) - Medium is Message

Theory! 

.center[
***The medium through which content is delivered is as significant as the content itself.***
]

--

Questions from McLuhan:

--

* Hot and cool media? 

--

* Are distances irrelevant - global village? 

---

## Interactivity v New Media v Communication Theory

--

1.More personalized & user-participated/controlled content

e.g.? 
--
Memes

--

2.New ways of engaging with audiences

--

* Demassification

--

* Asynchronicity


---

## Media Convergence

***Blending of multiple media forms into one***

from Napoli (2011). 

--


e.g. 
--
Facebook Messenger to post photos, send text, video call, buy AC

--

Users participate more! 

--

Democratization of content creation and distribution. 

--

e.g. TikTok

#### What is the internet?


[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)

"The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing."

Internet Protocol (IP)

* Every computer has an IP address

Wikipedia notes: "This article is about the worldwide computer network. For the global system of pages accessed through URLs via the Internet, see World Wide Web."

## So... What is World Wide Web (WWW?)

--

Some quotes from the WWW: 

"is a standardized system for accessing and navigating the internet" (Google Gemini accessed on 7/31/2024)

"are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online" [(BBC Bitesize, 2019)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/av/47523993)

## Deconstruct WWW and Internet

.big[
URL - Uniform Resource Locator
*or more commonly known as web address*

#### IP's are numbers for internet (cause internet knows numbers)

#### Domain Name System (DNS) - translates IP's to names for us humans

This is how we ask for a webpage:

| Protocol | Host               | Path    |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| https    | 2024.philemerge.com | /demo2/ |

.center[
**Protocol or HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
how to communicate with the web

**Host**
who hosts the website

**Path**
what do we want from the server/host?
